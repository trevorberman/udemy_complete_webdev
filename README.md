# Course Material and Exercises for the Complete Web Developer Course

This repo contains coursework and the finished project files for all the learning goals contained in the curriculum.

## Bonus: Progressive Enhancement

In addition to the foundational aspects of web development taught throughout, I have endeavored to build an extended set of core competencies upon a mishmash of occupational knowledge and an intense curiosity for "doing it right."

My web programming has become more efficient and more soundly engineered as the following practices have been systematically integrated into the regular routines I use to author code.

* Track all progress using git
* Lint all code in the editor
* Enforce formatting standards
* Conduct functional tests through Dev Tools linked to local source files
